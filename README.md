# bBase
The B team base code. Should work. Just run these commands, one after the other, in a new command prompt (Windows key + R, type `cmd`, and press enter).


```
git clone https://github.com/NoMod-Programming/bBase.git
cd bBase
pros mu
```

To re-download the latest version of the code, and then run it, run the following:

```
cd bBase
git fetch
git reset --hard origin/master
pros mu
```

Reach out to me via ryver if this doesn't work.
